       <h2> Who and Where I am Today</h2> 
      <p> I love to draw and create stories of my own original characters, I love to draw on my Ipad Pro in a app called Procreate,
        I enjoy to play intense story mode videogames on my Playstation 5 such as Grand Theft Auto 5, Red Dead Redemption 2, Batman arkham series, Mortal kombat,
        Hitman, uncharated series, and Assassain Creed. I also love to watch anime and cartoons. Ever since I watch Batman arkham Asylum videogame in the 2009 it 
       inspired me to create my very own original characters so I could show people around the world to look at my fiction stories. </p>
