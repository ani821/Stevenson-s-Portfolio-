    <h2> Where I started with Fan Art</h2>
    <p>
      I have always had a passion for drawing anime and comic book art. Ever since I was a child, I was drawn to
      characters in cartoons and comics. I would spend hours drawing my own versions of the characters I saw, and I
      quickly developed a love for the art form.
      I began to explore the world of anime and comic art more in depth when I entered high school. I discovered new and
      exciting characters, stories, and worlds, and I was inspired to create my own characters and stories to share with
      other fans. I also expanded my own skills by studying the works of other artists and trying to replicate their
      techniques.
      My passion for anime and comic art has only grown over the years. I continue to practice and refine my own skills,
      and I am always looking for new ideas and inspirations. I have created several art pieces that I am proud to share
      with others. I also attend conventions and other events to meet up with other fans and admire their work.
      My passion for anime and comic art has become part of who I am. I find it to be a great form of creative
      expression that allows me to share stories and characters with the world. I am constantly learning and growing as
      an artist, and I look forward to the new experiences and challenges that come with it. I am confident that my
      passion for anime and comic art will continue to be a part of my life for many years to come.
      Drawing artwork and fanart can be an incredibly rewarding and creative hobby. </p>
